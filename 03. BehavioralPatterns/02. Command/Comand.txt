Original Definition:
 Command encapsulates a request as an object and lets you parameterize clients with different requests.

Redefinition:
 Command encapsulates a request by hiding the request serving concrete object behind the command interface.
 When a client hands its request on to a server, the server provides the client with an appropriate command object under the command interface.
